Coin Calculator 
===============

I always use an online calculator to find out the value of the gold or silver content for a given coin.  After a few uses I didn't likehow it worked and figured this would be a fun exercise to do using JSON, Javascript and letting others look at the code on Github.

As I complete this tool, I will finish the documentation and provide notes on how I completed this simple calculator.
