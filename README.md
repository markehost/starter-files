A Nice Starting Point  
===============

This is my personal starting point when starting markup and style from scratch.  I don't like to have too much in the way from HTML5 Boilerplate and Bootstrap.  

Every site is different so I just need the basics.  Anything that is common to nearly all project goes in this repository.
